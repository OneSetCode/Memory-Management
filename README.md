# Memory Management
The project involved developing and benchmarking a memory management package, focusing on procedural programming, memory management, and software tools. The project consisted of implementing a memory management package with functionalities similar to the standard library 'malloc' and 'free' functions. Additionally, a benchmarking program was created to evaluate the memory management package's performance. The package included functions such as getmem to allocate memory, freemem to release memory, get_mem_stats to retrieve memory statistics, and print_heap to display information about the free blocks. The implementation required managing a free list of memory blocks, combining adjacent blocks, and efficiently acquiring memory from the underlying system.
